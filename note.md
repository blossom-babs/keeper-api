<!-- considering

1. send verification to email
2. refactor code such that password verification (bcrypt compare happens on the user model not handler)

2.  Associate notes with user
3.  Labels: create, edit, delete, return
4.  Associate labels with notes and users


<!-- this feels a bit like cheating
